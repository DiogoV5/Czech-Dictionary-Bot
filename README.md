# Czech-Dictionary-Bot
### The telegram chat bot in Python to learn czech language. A couple of games and some grammar are available.
### My old project in Python written in 2021. When I started to learn Czech, I was interested in Python development, so I have created a light chat bot with mini games to learn words. Unfortunately, it is not localised for English speaker, it is only in Russian. And for today it is not in use.

* 🈚️ Translate to Russian - you are given a word in Czech and have to write it in Russian. You have two attepmts;
* 🪥 Write a word - you are given a word with a picture in Russian and have to write in Czech, using Czech keyboard;
