# Czech-Dictionary-Bot
### My old project, written in Python in 2021, was a Telegram chatbot designed to help me learn Czech. At the time, I was interested in developing with Python, and so I created a chatbot that offered a couple of games and some grammar exercises to help users learn new words.
### Unfortunately, the chatbot is only available in Russian and is not localized for English/Czech speakers. As a result, it is not currently in use.
## Features:
* 📔 Dictionary - words are being showed in two languages with 3 seconds interval;
* 🆚 Choose word - words are being showed with pictures (from internet) and two words in Czech, you have to choose the correct one;
* 💠 Choose word from 4 - words are being showed with pictures (from internet) and four words in Czech, you have to choose the correct one;
* 🈚️ Translate to Russian - you are given a word in Czech and have to write it in Russian. You have two attepmts;
* 🪥 Write a word - you are given a word with a picture in Russian and have to write in Czech, using Czech keyboard;
